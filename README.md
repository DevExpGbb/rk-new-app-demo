[Brief description of your project - what it does and its main purpose]

> **Template Note**: This is a boilerplate README for Node.js Express.js applications. Replace bracketed placeholders with your project-specific information.

## About This Project

This is a Node.js Express.js application with essential middleware and routing setup, designed to serve as both a functional application and a template for future projects.

## Features

This boilerplate includes the following production-ready features:

- **Express.js server** - Fast, unopinionated web framework
- **Security middleware (Helmet)** - Security headers and protections
- **CORS support** - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration
- **Request logging (Morgan)** - HTTP request logger middleware
- **JSON and URL-encoded body parsing** - Built-in request body parsing
- **Basic error handling** - Centralized error handling middleware
- **Health check endpoint** - Application health monitoring
- **Sample API routes** - Example routes to get started

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Security**: Helmet.js
- **Logging**: Morgan
- **Development**: Nodemon for auto-reload

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** - Package manager (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if using this as a template):
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [your-project-directory]
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables** (optional):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Running the Application

Choose one of the following methods to start the server:

#### Development Mode (with auto-reload)
For development with automatic server restart on file changes:
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Production Mode
For production deployment:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3000 by default. You can customize this by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

**Access your application**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## API Endpoints

This boilerplate includes several example endpoints to demonstrate functionality:

### Core Endpoints
- **`GET /`** - Welcome message and application info
- **`GET /health`** - Health check endpoint for monitoring

### Sample API Routes
- **`GET /api/users`** - Retrieve all users (demo data)
- **`POST /api/users`** - Create a new user

> **Customization**: Replace these sample endpoints with your actual API routes. The routing structure in `src/routes/` makes it easy to organize your endpoints.

## Project Structure

This project follows a clean, modular structure that's easy to understand and extend:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # Source code directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.js             # Main application file with server setup
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/            # Configuration files
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js       # Environment and app configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ routes/            # API route definitions
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.js       # Route handlers and middleware
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example           # Environment variables template
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Project dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json     # Dependency lock file
â””â”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation (this file)
```

### Key Directories
- **`src/`** - All application source code
- **`src/config/`** - Configuration management
- **`src/routes/`** - API endpoint definitions

> **Tip**: As your project grows, consider adding directories like `middleware/`, `models/`, `services/`, or `utils/` within the `src/` folder.

## Environment Variables

Configure your application using these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `PORT` | Server port number | `3000` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Application environment | `development` |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | CORS allowed origins | `*` |

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` with your specific values:
```bash
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

> **Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Add any new environment variables to `.env.example` for documentation.

## Customizing This Boilerplate

This template is designed to be easily customizable for your specific needs:

### 1. Update Project Information
- Replace `[Project Name]` and descriptions with your actual project details
- Update `package.json` with your project name, description, and author
- Modify the welcome message in `src/app.js`

### 2. Add Your Routes
- Replace sample routes in `src/routes/index.js` with your actual API endpoints
- Create additional route files for different API modules
- Update the API Endpoints section in this README

### 3. Configure Environment
- Add your specific environment variables to `.env.example`
- Update the Environment Variables table above
- Modify `src/config/index.js` for additional configuration

### 4. Extend Functionality
- Add database connections (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Implement authentication middleware
- Add validation libraries (e.g., Joi, express-validator)
- Include testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, etc.)

## Development

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Start the production server |
| `npm run dev` | Start development server with auto-reload |
| `npm test` | Run tests (add your test framework) |

### Adding Dependencies

For additional functionality, consider these popular packages:

```bash
# Database
npm install mongoose          # MongoDB ODM
npm install pg sequelize     # PostgreSQL ORM

# Authentication
npm install jsonwebtoken bcryptjs passport

# Validation
npm install joi express-validator

# Testing
npm install jest supertest --save-dev
```
